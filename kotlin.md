The Layout Editor helps you create the UI for your Android app.
Almost everything you see on the screen of your app is a View.
A TextView is a UI element for displaying text in your app.
A ConstraintLayout is a container for other UI elements.
Views need to be constrained horizontally and vertically within a ConstraintLayout.
One way to position a View is with a margin.
A margin says how far a View is from an edge of the container it's in.
You can set attributes on a TextView like the font, text size, and color.
